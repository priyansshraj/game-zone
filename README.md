# Game Store Website

This project is a **game store website** built using **ReactJS**, designed to display a list of games by fetching their details from an external API. The goal of this project is to implement and showcase my learning of ReactJS, APIs, and eventually integrate database functionalities.

## Features

- **Game Listing**: Fetch game details (name, genre, image, publisher, etc.) from a third-party API and display them beautifully on the website.
- **Dynamic Search**: Users can search for games by categories, genres, or other filters.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

### Planned Features (Future Enhancements)
- **User Ratings and Reviews**: Users will be able to rate games and leave comments on the website.
- **Database Integration**: Store user ratings, reviews, and game information in a database.
- **User Authentication**: Implement a login system for users to manage their reviews.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: ReactJS (functional components, hooks)
- **API**: Game data fetched using third-party APIs such as [RAWG API](https://rawg.io/apidocs), [IGDB API](https://api-docs.igdb.com/), or [Giant Bomb API](https://www.giantbomb.com/api/documentation)
- **Styling**: CSS for responsive design
- **Future Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB (planned)

## Usage

- Once the development server is running, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.
- Use the search functionality to filter games by genre or other categories.
- All game details are fetched dynamically from the API.
